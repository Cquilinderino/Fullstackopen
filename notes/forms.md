# Forms basics

<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <label for="mail">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="mail" name="user_email" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <label for="msg">Message:</label>
      <textarea id="msg" name="user_message"></textarea>
    </li>
    <li class="button">
        <button type="submit">Send your message</button>
    </li>
  </ul>
</form>

the __for__ has to be the same as __id__
__name__ is the 'variable' name on the JS side
if the data is submitted it would look something like

data {
    user_name:...,
    user_email:...,
    user_message:...,
}

buttons can have type submit, reset or button
A click on a submit button (the default value) sends the form's data to the web page defined by the action attribute of the <form> element.
A click on a reset button resets all the form widgets to their default value immediately. From a UX point of view, this is considered bad practice, so you should avoid using this type of button unless you really have a good reason to include one.
A click on a button button does nothing! That sounds silly, but it's amazingly useful for building custom buttons — you can define their chosen functionality with JavaScript.
